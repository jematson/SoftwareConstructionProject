---Bine installation---
In order to install and run Bine on your device, you must have MongoDB installed. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/#mongodb-installation-tutorials to do this. It is a free and safe software.
Next, in your OS's terminal, you must navigate to the folder containing this document and run the following command:

node myServer.js

This will boot up Bine on your local host. Open the web browser of your choice and navigate to localhost:10000. Here you should be presented with an operational Bine.
